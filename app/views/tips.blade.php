<h1>Pick.Cool Strategy Guide</h1>

<p>So, you joined a pick. What now? How are the winners getting so many votes?

<p>Winning a pick is a test of your <b>social marketing</b> skills. Even if you don't feel like you have the biggest social network to draw from, you can still do a lot to improve your standing in the pick.
  
<p><b>Always Be Talking</b></p>
<p>This is not fight club. The first rule of being in a pick is you ALWAYS talk about the pick! Your most critical path to winning the pick is SHARING your voting link DAILY. You might think that's too frequent, and you should be the judge. But we know from studying the data and behavioral patterns that most people DO NOT see every post you make. It takes about 7 posts before someone sees it ONCE.
  
<p><b>Share Daily</b></p>
<p>Did we mention DAILY? It is important because not everyone will see all your posts. Post up to twice per day at differing times of day.
  
<p><b>Create a Facebook Event</b></p>
<p>The biggest winners create their own 'Vote for Me' style Facebook event. People can indicate that they are 'going', meaning they voted, and that spreads the news.
  
<p><b>Get Friends to Share</b></p>
<p>This is the signle most powerful difference we see between the people at the top of the pick and the people at the bottom. Once your friends begin to share your pick link, it catches fire. You begin to get votes from friends of friends, etc.
  
<p><b>Share Outside Facebook</b></p>
<p>Think about Twitter and other places you hang out. Spread the link far and wide.

<p><b>Use *YOUR* Share Link</b></p>
<p>Go to your vote profile page and share THAT link rather than sharing the generic contest link. Your unique entry page link will contain your name and image when you share it. Much more effective.

<p><b>Tag Your Friends</b></p>
<p>Friends tagged in your post are far more likely to see it and respond.
  
<p><b>Make Daily Videos</b></p>
<p>Make funny or informative posts on Facebook and tag your friends. Tagging will increase your visibility in their feeds and in some cases will make you visible to *their* friends - even better!y.

<p><b>Start a Friendly Rivalry</b></p>
<p>The most successful pick winners make videos and start friendly rivalries to cook up voter interest.

<p><b>Promote the Sponsors</b></p>
<p>Be a good sport. Promote others too, you'd be surprised what that can do for your own standing. Promote a sponsor, they might just promote you back.
