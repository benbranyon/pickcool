Our records indicate that on {{$vote->voted_at}} your recent vote in {{{$contest->title}}} was not recorded properly. Our top priority is to keep voting absolutely fair, so we monitor our systems to ensure that all votes are recorded correctly. In a few cases since 1/7/2015, some votes by some users were not recorded properly, even though it may have appeared to work. This problem did not affect all users, but it did affect your vote.

I want to personally apologize for this inconvenience. It was my own programming error that caused the problem, and it is fixed now. I know every line of code inside and out, and this one just got by me. So I apologize for this inconvenience and understand how important voting accuracy is. That is why I am being totally honest and sending this message to all affected voters. I have a great deal of care and enthusiasm for every model in the pick and want to see them all succeed.

As well, I want to express deep gratitude to everyone for bearing with me as we iron out technical difficulties that are bound to occur with a new site. pick.cool went online just three short weeks ago and has already gained thousands of users. So we are growing fast, and that means some growing pains. It's our fault; this one is on me, and we really appreciate everyone's trust and encouragement as we build this new local voting platform. It's about community and celebrating local talent and highlights, and we hope you share that vision with us.

I don't want to spam you, but it's really important to me that your vote counts as you intended. So I'm going to send this message every day unless I hear back from you.

Best,
Ben Allfree
Co-founder, pick.cool
